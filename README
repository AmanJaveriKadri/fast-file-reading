README - Text File Loader
Aman Javeri Kadri

The basic purpose of this module is to load a text file into memory in a well-organized,
fast and memory-efficient manner. 

The read_lines function packages most of what this module has to offer by taking as
parameters - a string with the filename to be read, an integer number of lines in the file
and a pointer where an array of integers specifying the number of characters in each line 
read will be declared and initialized. This function reads every line of the file named 
and stores each line as a string in an array of strings that is returned by the function.
The first line of the file will be found at index 0 of the array and so on.

One may refer to the header file for a description of the other functions available to use 
in this module.
